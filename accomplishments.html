        <p>I will attach a professional resume to my personal website, where you will be able to view my work experience. As far as some of the things I have accomplished, I am an Eagle Scout and received that award when I participated in the scouting program as a youth. I also served as Captain of my high school wrestling team for two years, and again, returned from being a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Many Thanks Thank you for being here, reading my website and taking the time to learn about me! I know this site is necessary especially for those looking at my work from a professional standpoint. If you have any questions after reading through my site, feel free to contact me at one of the links provided. Many thanks again!</p>
