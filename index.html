            <p>Hello everybody! Welcome to my personal website! My name is Caleb Balmforth. I am currently a Software Engineering major, and I am in my first year at BYU-Idaho! The goal of this website is to be a personal portfolio, in which I get to display some things about me, such as who I am and where I am from, what I like to do, and even my personal resume of things that I have accomplished.</p>

            <p>
                Whether you are a family member, a friend, or an employer, I hope you enjoy learning a little bit about me! Although my website is for anybody, my main objective is to have something to show future employers. Number one, I will have a resume of my accomplishments for people to view. Number two, this website will also serve as a project that I could use to show employers in the Web Design or Software Development industry the things that I have worked on and the code that I have written and programming languages that I have experience with.
            </p>

            <p>
                There will also be a download link here on the website to my contact info, which can be found through my resume, should anyone ever decide to reach out to me with questions about me or about my work.
            </p>
