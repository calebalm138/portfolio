      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of my website is a simple one. Have you ever wanted to see a website that is solely dedicated to giving information about someone? My idea is to create a website that simply gives the user information about the site developer, me! My name is Caleb Balmforth, and I am very new to site development, but I will be creating my very own personal portfolio. I want the website to share a little bit of information about who I am, what my hobbies are, and the goals I hope to accomplish in the future. If you ever wanted to learn more about me, this website will be the perfect place to go.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience will be anyone that wants to learn more about me, whether it be family and friends, or employers and coworkers!</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Welcome to my Personal Website!
Hello everybody! Welcome to my personal website! My name is Caleb Balmforth. I am currently a Software Engineering major, and I am in my first year at BYU-Idaho! The goal of this website is to be a personal portfolio, in which I get to display some things about me, such as who I am and where I am from, what I like to do, and even my personal resume of things that I have accomplished. Whether you are a family member, a friend, or an employer, I hope you enjoy learning a little bit about me!

What Questions Can be Answered
Although my website is for anybody, my main objective is to have something to show future employers. Number one, I will have a resume of my accomplishments for people to view. Number two, this website will also serve as a project that I could use to show employers  in the Web Design or Software Development industry the things that I have worked on and the code that I have written and programming languages that I have experience with. There will also be links here on the website to my contact info, should anyone ever decide to reach out to me with questions about me or about my work.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        About Me
Here is a little bit about me! I grew up in Shelley, Idaho and lived there for about 15 years of my life. When I was in middle school I moved to Utah with my family and lived there up until I graduated high school. I made many friends there and I loved it there. After high school, I served a two year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in the Texas Dallas West Mission. I also made many friends there, both with the people I got to serve with, and those that I was able to serve. I returned home and then began the next endeavor of my life, which brought me to college, here at BYU-Idaho! While I am in college my plan is to pursue a degree in Software Engineering and search for a path that will lead me to a great career.

My Hobbies
One of my favorite things to do is sports. I am a wrestler, and have wrestled almost my whole life, up through high school. I continue to stay involved as my younger siblings and cousins participate in the sport. I also love playing pickleball or spikeball, and I like to watch football. I also have a passion for music, as I play the piano and you will usually always find me listening to music of some sort. I like to watch movies as well. Sometimes you will find me outdoors enjoying nature with friends and family which is always something that I enjoy as well.

      <h3>My Accomplishments</h3>
      <p>
        My Resume and Accomplishments
I will attach a professional resume to my personal website, where you will be able to view my work experience. As far as some of the things I have accomplished, I am an Eagle Scout and received that award when I participated in the scouting program as a youth. I also served as Captain of my high school wrestling team for two years, and again, returned from being a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
