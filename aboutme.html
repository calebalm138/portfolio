        <h1 class="about-me-headline">About Me</h1>
        <p>Here is a little bit about me! I grew up in Shelley, Idaho and lived there for about 15 years of my life. When I was in middle school I moved to Utah with my family and lived there up until I graduated high school. I made many friends there and I loved it there. After high school, I served a two year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in the Texas Dallas West Mission. I also made many friends there, both with the people I got to serve with, and those that I was able to serve. I returned home and then began the next endeavor of my life, which brought me to college, here at BYU-Idaho! While I am in college my plan is to pursue a degree in Software Engineering and search for a path that will lead me to a great career.</p>

        <h2 class="my-hobbies">My Hobbies</h2>

        <p>One of my favorite things to do is sports. I am a wrestler, and have wrestled almost my whole life, up through high school. I continue to stay involved as my younger siblings and cousins participate in the sport. I also love playing pickleball or spikeball, and I like to watch football. I also have a passion for music, as I play the piano and you will usually always find me listening to music of some sort. I like to watch movies as well. Sometimes you will find me outdoors enjoying nature with friends and family which is always something that I enjoy as well.</p>
